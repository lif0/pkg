## Overview

This package provides lightweight concurrency primitives that avoid unnecessary allocations and focus on correctness and performance.

Currently available:

- `Semaphore` â€” counting semaphore built using buffered channels.

---

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/lif0/pkg/concurrency@latest
```

---

## Usage

### Semaphore

A simple counting semaphore implemented.

```go
sem := concurrency.NewSemaphore(3)

sem.Acquire()
// critical section
sem.Release()
```

Unlimited semaphore

```go
sem := concurrency.NewSemaphore(0)

sem.Release() // no panic, because for unlimited no-op
sem.Acquire()
// critical section
sem.Release()
```

## Roadmap

- [] FanIn/FunOut
- [] Future/Promise
- [] MS Queue
