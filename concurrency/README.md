## Overview

This package provides lightweight concurrency primitives that avoid unnecessary allocations and focus on correctness and performance.

Currently available:

- `Semaphore` â€” counting semaphore built using buffered channels.
- `Semaphore64` â€” zero-allocation, atomic-based semaphore using bit operations.

---

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/lif0/pkg/concurrency@latest
```

---

## Usage

### Semaphore

A simple counting semaphore implemented via buffered channels.

```go
sem := concurrency.NewSemaphore(3)

sem.Acquire()
// critical section
sem.Release()
```

### Semaphore64

A zero-allocation semaphore using atomic and bit manipulation. Suitable for high-performance scenarios. But it has only 64 slots;

```go
var sem concurrency.Semaphore64

ok := sem.TryAcquire()
if ok {
    // critical section
    sem.Release()
}
```
