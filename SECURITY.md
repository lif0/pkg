## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repo, please report it responsibly. We appreciate your efforts to disclose issues privately and allow us time to respond before any public disclosure.

### How to Report
- **GitHub Security Alerts**: If enabled, you can also submit via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature (available in repository settings under Security > Vulnerability reporting).
- **Include details**: Provide a clear description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, potential impact, and any proof-of-concept code (if safe to share). Do not include exploits in public issues.
- **Create a GitHub Issue**: Alternatively, if email or private reporting isnâ€™t an option, create a GitHub Issue with a clear title and description. Ensure you apply the `security` label to the issue to flag it appropriately. Avoid sharing sensitive details publicly unless advised.

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: We aim to acknowledge your report within 2 days.
- **Initial Assessment**: We'll evaluate the issue and provide an update within 7 days.
- **Resolution**: If accepted, we'll work on a fix and release it in a timely manner, typically within 30-90 days depending on severity. You'll be credited in the release notes unless you prefer anonymity.
- **Declined Reports**: If the report is declined (e.g., not a vulnerability or out of scope), we'll explain why and suggest alternatives if applicable.
